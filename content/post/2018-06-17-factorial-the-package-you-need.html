<h1>Everyone’s Favourite Operation</h1>
<p>Factorial, commonly symbolised as (!) is the mathematical function whereby you multiply every number from 1, leading up to the number from the number you’re taking the factorial of. For example 5! is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 or 120.</p>
<p>It’s simple enough to perform this operation with pure brainpower when dealing with small numbers, but as you scale up it becomes even more difficult to do so. And who wants to waste time typing 15 numbers into the console when you can use the handy dandy Factorial package to do it for you? All you have to do is the use the Factorial function, within the Factorial package to get the number you need!</p>
<p>You’re probably asking yourself right now why you would ever need to take the factorial of a number, that doesn’t seem like an everyday function, does it? You’d be interested to know that if you ever wanted to cheat in a card game (we’ve all thought about it) you’ll need a working comprehension of factorials in order to calculate the probability of favourable outcomes. Neat!</p>
<p>Go forth and confidently gamble your savings away with the Factorial package, now available at [<a href="https://github.com/Andrea-Makamba/Factorial" class="uri">https://github.com/Andrea-Makamba/Factorial</a>] !</p>
