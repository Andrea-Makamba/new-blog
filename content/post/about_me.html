<p>Alors, ça c’est une petite redaction sur moi, l’auteur de cette site.</p>
<p>Bonjour! My name is Andrea Makamba, and if you haven’t gathered by now, I speak both English and French.</p>
<p>I am 19 years old, from Zimbabwe (Southern Africa, the country that is shaped like a teapot). I love it here. The open veld spaces, favourable weather, friendly people, what isn’t there to love about this country? I’m currently an undergraudte student at The University of Pennsylvania- go Quakers! And what would I like to study? At the moment, I’m majoring in Systems Engineering and minoring in French &amp; Francophone Studies and Mathematics. What can I say? I’m a nerd of the highest order.</p>
<p>When I’m not cooking, reading books or binge watching Adventuretime, I pass my time in the great outdoors. I play sport all year round, dividing my time between cross country, tennis and skiing.</p>
